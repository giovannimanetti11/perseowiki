## Summary

perseowiki is a WordPress theme developed by Giovanni Manetti. It does not use any boilerplate so it will not have any unused JS. It also does not use any page builders.
If you want to use this theme feel free, but please note that there is a lot of customization involved. I may not be able to provide support for the installation at all times, but you can contact me at giovanni[at]perseodesign.com.

Getting Started
---------------
