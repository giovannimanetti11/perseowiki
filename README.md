## Summary

Perseowiki is a clean and lightweight WordPress theme developed by Giovanni Manetti, designed to provide a wiki-like experience. The theme does not use any boilerplate, which ensures no unused JavaScript is included. Additionally, it avoids using page builders for a more streamlined and efficient performance.

Please note that using this theme may require a considerable amount of customization. While I may not always be available to provide support for the installation, feel free to contact me at giovanni[at]perseodesign.com for any questions or concerns.

Getting Started
---------------
