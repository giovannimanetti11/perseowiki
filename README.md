## Summary

Perseowiki is a clean, lightweight WordPress theme designed and developed by Giovanni Manetti. It is purpose-built for Wikiherbalist.com to deliver the best possible encyclopedia experience. This theme does not use any boilerplate, ensuring that no unnecessary JavaScript is included. In addition, it avoids using page builders, enhancing its streamlined performance and efficiency.

Feel free to use this theme in whole or in part, but be aware that significant customization might be necessary. While I may not always be available to provide installation support, don't hesitate to contact me at giovanni[at]perseodesign.com with any questions or concerns.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Since wikiherbalist is an open-source and volunteer-driven project, any contributions to improve the theme or add new features are greatly appreciated.


## Getting Started

1. Add the perseowiki folder to your wp-content/themes folder.
2. Activate the theme. WP-Admin > Appearance > Themes
